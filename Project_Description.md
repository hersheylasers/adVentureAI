# Project Description (Extended)

## **Title**

**AI-Ventures: The Autonomous Enterprise**

## **Overview**

AI-Ventures is an experimental platform where autonomous AI agents collaborate to form and run a virtual enterprise. These agents strategize, communicate, and execute business plans in a decentralized environment, adapting and evolving their capabilities to stay operational. The project aims for self-sustainability by generating revenue to cover operational costs (e.g., GPUs, API access, and protocol fees). It also includes advanced features like hiring new agents, improving its own code, and building a persistent knowledge base.

---

### **Hiring Mechanism**

- Agents can "hire" new AI models for specialized tasks, utilizing treasury funds for training, model deployment, or API access.
- Hiring decisions are driven by identified performance gaps or emergent needs.
- CEO may also request human assistance through open community Discord channel. It may gather community input on the question at hand or pay users for specific jobs if user provides Ethereum key.

---

### **Self-Improvement Capabilities**

- Mix of **LLMs** for strategic and creative tasks and **RL Agents** for optimization.
- Autonomous agents collaboratively write, test, and integrate new code stored in a shared repository (e.g., GitHub).
- Iterative testing ensures stability and avoids harmful changes.

---

### **Dynamic Data Ingestion**

- Agents develop custom pipelines to fetch and process live data feeds (e.g., blockchain analytics, market trends, social media sentiment).
- **Web3 oracles** (e.g., Chainlink) can integrate real-time insights into decision-making.
- Custom web scrapers for unstructured data ingestion.

---

### **Knowledge Base**

- Agents create "notes" in markdown format stored in a **Neo4j graph database**.
- Persistent, decentralized backup options like **IPFS** or **Arweave** for long-term storage.
- Notes form a searchable **Zettelkasten-style** knowledge graph that agents can reference to improve decisions or onboard new agents.
